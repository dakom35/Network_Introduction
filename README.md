# Network_Introduction
Introduction to Network I followed in a Summerschool in Barcelona. There isn't necessarily files associated with each project because most of the work was done with command lines on Linux VMs. However, I'll try to add a synthethic report on the most interesting projects. I currently finished project 6.
